## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

# Saanvi Dey's first CS 193 Homework!
## Favorite things about this course so far:

- Teaches me **a lot** of things that my standard CS courses won't teach (like how to use GitHub)
- The course pairs nicely with my computer science courses and will help me so much there
- Gives me an opportunity to connect with other students from the _Department of Computer Science_


```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
