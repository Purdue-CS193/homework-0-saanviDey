# Saanvi Dey's First CS 193 Homework!
## My favorite things about CS 193 so far...

- Teaches me **a lot** of things a standard CS class won't teach (like how to use GitHub)
- Can make my CS 180 (and future classes) easier because I'm learning how to use some of the software
- Gives me an opportunity to meet new people from the _Department of Computer Science_
